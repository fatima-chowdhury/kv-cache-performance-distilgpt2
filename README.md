# kv-cache-performance-distilgpt2
This assignment helps to study how memory systems and architectural limits affect inference, focusing on the Keyâ€“Value (KV) cache, including verifying insights by coding and measuring real runs on distilgpt2.
The main coding files are: exp1_kvcache.py, exp2_batching.py and exp3_scaling.py
The .csv, .png files are output files which have also been presented in the report.

I used ChatGPT to understand how to answer Part B questions eg. numbers 3,4,5,6,7 and used chatGPT to tweak the codes and makes graphs/tables.
